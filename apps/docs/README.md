## Getting Started

To add or edit the Outstatic documentation, please, fork the project and update
the environment variables based on the `.env.local.example` file.

On your `.env.local` file add your GitHub credentials and your `OST_REPO_BRANCH`,
which should be the branch you are using to make modifications to the docs.

Note that the `/apps/docs` code uses `basePath` from Next.js. More info [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/basePath).

You can log in to Outstatic at `http://localhost:3000/docs/oustatic`.

Once you are done modifying the docs, create a Pull Request.

We'll review it as soon as possible. Thank you!
